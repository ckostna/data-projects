This repository includes the following files:
 1) New York Housing Data Analysis (RMD)
      - This analysis was performed in a third year course to utilize our R and webscraping skills
      - My group chose to analyze the differences in characteristics of houses in Saratoga, NY from 2006 and today
      - We used multiple visualization techniques, linear regression, and correlation
 2) Deforestation Analysis (RMD & PDF)
      - This analysis was performed in a second year course to utilize our R skills
      - My partner and I chose to analyze how destructive deforestation (specifically in Brazil) has been, and what the main causes are
      - We used summary statistics, rankings, multiple visualization techinques, linear regression, and correlation
 3) ML Binary Image Classification (Jupyter Notebook)
      - This machine learning project was performed in a third year course to utilize our Python and model construction skills
      - My partner and I chose to find the most effective model that would correctly identify the class of an image (either dark chocolate or white chocolate)
      - We defined functions, used built-in models, created a convolutional neural network, and tweaked our models by finding optimal hyper-parameters
 4) Coffee Rating Analysis (RMD & PDF)
      - This analysis was performed in a third year statistics course to utilize our R skills as well as concepts we learned throughout the semester
      - I chose to analyze how each coffee quality measure in the dataset was structured, and how they are related to or influence one another
      - I used various data visualization techniques in the preliminary analysis, and then used tests of means, confidence intervals, linear regression, and classification
